# CAR MILEGE PREDICTION
<h3>Summary</h3>
A Linear Regression model to predict car fuel economy (in mpg) given various specifications: {cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year, origin}. Currently, Root Mean Square error is around 3.7 mpg.

<h3>Dataset Descriptions</h3>
 Variables that are abliviable in dataset are 
1. mpg:           continuous
2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete
3. displacement:  continuous
4. horsepower:    continuous
5. weight:        continuous
6. acceleration:  continuous
7. model year:    multi-valued discrete
8. origin:        multi-valued discrete
9. car name:      string (unique for each instance)
