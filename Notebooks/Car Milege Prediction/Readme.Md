# CAR MILEGE PREDICTION
<h3>Summary</h3>
A Linear Regression model to predict car fuel economy (in mpg) given various specifications: {cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, year, origin}. Currently, Root Mean Square error is around 3.7 mpg.

Dataset Descriptions

Variables that are available  in  the dataset are 
1. mpg:           continuous
2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete
3. displacement:  continuous
4. horsepower:    continuous
5. weight:        continuous
6. acceleration:  continuous
7. model year:    multi-valued discrete
8. origin:        multi-valued discrete
9. car name:      string (unique for each instance)

Problem Statement

In this model you will investigate the impact of a number of automobile
engine factors on the vehicle's mpg. The dataset auto-mpg.data contains infor-
mation for 398 dierent automobile models. Information regarding the number
of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin,
and car name as well as mpg are contained in the file.
